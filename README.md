# M365_Admin_License_Export
As a Microsoft Admin I needed to monthly export list (CSV) of purchased licenses based on the country they're used in and send them via e-mail (Google API) to the finacial office.

Google Cloud is required for the e-mail setup. Since SMTP login has been deprecated by Google.
